    <h1>Components</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>With react we describe the UI using components</li>
        <li>Components are like JavaScript functions</li>
        <li>A component takes in parameters called props(short for properties) and returns a hierarchy of views to display via
        the render method</li>
        <li>The render method takes the description and displays the result</li>
        <li>render returns a react element which is a light weight description of what to render</li>
        <li>most React developers use JSX which makes these structures easier to write</li>
        <li>A component can maintain internal state data (accessed via this.state)</li>
        <li>When a components state data changes, the rendered markup will be updated by revoking render()</li>
        <li>We use components to tell React what we want on our screen</li>
        <li>When our data changes, React will efficiently update and re-render out components</li>
        <li>Components receive certain input objects and they output description of a user interface</li>
        <li>We can reuse a single component in multiple user interfaces</li>
        <li>Components can contain other components</li>
        <li>You just use a component in your HTML just like it was a normal HTML element</li>
        <li>React components can hold a private state to hold any data that may change over the lifecycle of the component
        to hold any data that may change over the lifecycle of the component</li>
        <li>A react component can be one of two types
        <ul>
            <li>Function Component</li>
            <li>Class Component</li></ul>
        </li>
        <li>Both types of components can be compared to regular functions when it comes to their contract<ul>
            <li>Both use a set of props and state as their input, and they output what looks like html, but what is really output is
            a javaScript syntax called jsx</li>
            <li>The props input is an explicit one, it is similar to the list of attributes an HTML element has</li>
            <li>The state input is an internal one, and auto reflects the changes in the browser</li>
            <li>The two input objects have a difference: within a component the state object can be changed while the props object represents fixed values</li>
            <li>Props are immutable</li>
            <li>Components can change their internal state, not there properties</li>
        </ul></li>
        <li>to remember things components use state</li>
        <li>React components can have a state by setting this.state om their constructors</li>
        <li>This state should be considered as private to a React component that it's defined in </li>

    </ul>
